HUMAN:

tells you about the zombi robot invasion, gives you a gun, explains peew peew



"will you come with me?"
"nah"
"but we humans need to stick together, it´s dangerous to stay alone"
"mind your own business"
/"it would be too easy if I came and shot half the zombies for you, now would it?"



vuelve:
"didn´t you have blond hair when kneeling down?"
"what?"
"your hair.... it was a different color"
"I don´t know what you´re talking about"

"I saw one robot explode in a bloodbath.... what was that? where did the blood come from?"
"cool, wasn´t it?"
"but...  how was that possible?"
"you ask many questions...  just shut up and shoot at stuff"
"aren´t you coming?"
"nah"
"can´t you see it´s hard for me to walk? I limp weirdly, it´s quite obvious.. how didn´t you see that?"


"oh by the way, you´re holding the gun badly... turn it over and that´s how you shoot a much more powerfull shot, by saying Boom in a deep voice!"
"all this time you didn´t tell me???"
"nope, it was quite funny to see you struggling with it"

tells you to shoot the reactor
"what is that thing?"
"who knows.. but it´s glowing and looks kind of cool, if they put so much effort in it I bet it´s like the final enemy or something... just shoot it"


when you shoot the reactot his eyes turn red or something
"haha you just shot the reactor,  now this whole place is blowing up and I´m taking the only escape pod!   oh and I´m a robot by the way¨
"what?? since when??"
"since I was assembled"
"no but you didn´t get my question..."
"what was it then?"
"I meant... like...   WTF?"
"oh, right. Well you see it was kind of obvious, can´t you see I´m all pixely and shit and that I move mechanically? this is the worst disguise in the world..."
"I had no idea"
"SERIOUSLY??"
"yeah, it was quite convincing"
"well,  thanks I guess"
"you´re wellcome.  Wait, what were you saying about the ship blowing up?"
"ah yes, it´s blowing up and you´re going to die"
"oh"
"well I guess this is goodbye"
"wait"
"what?"
"you´re taking the last escape pod?"
"yes"
"but you tricked me into this. That wasn´t very nice"
"I guess not, but I´m a robot, you see being nice isn´t in my programming"
"oh, sorry, I guess I can´t blame you then"
"so anyway... I´d like to stay and chat but I don´t want to blow up"
"of course.  ...But wait!"
"WHAT?"
"I´m thinking...    like,  if I shot you and killed you... then there´d be a free place in the escape pod"
"that makes sense, what´s your point?"
"that you tricked me... that wasn´t very nice"
"yes, you´ve said that already"
"no but...  I think I´m in my right to shoot you, right?"
"no, you´re not"
"why not?"
"you ask many questions"
"you´re trying to trick me again!"
"haha guilty!"
"oh haha you´re such a mischievous one!"
"well I guess I´ll have to kill you first"
"haha right... wait what?"
"PREPARE TO DIE!"
